# ✅ FINAL FIX - Using Your Dedicated Pinata Gateway

## 🎯 Solution

You have a **dedicated Pinata subdomain** that works perfectly:
```
https://orange-electrical-gopher-771.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/
```

## ✅ What Was Changed

### File: `frontend/src/utils/ipfs.ts`

**Updated Gateway Priority:**
```typescript
const IPFS_GATEWAYS = [
  'https://orange-electrical-gopher-771.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/', // Primary: YOUR gateway
  'https://dweb.link/ipfs/',                                     // Fallback #1
  'https://ipfs.io/ipfs/',                                       // Fallback #2
];
```

## 🧪 Test Results

Both certificate images verified working with your gateway:

| Certificate | IPFS Hash | Status | Type | Size |
|-------------|-----------|--------|------|------|
| **NEW "Dr. Principal"** | `bafkrei...blsu` | ✅ **200 OK** | image/png | 30,639 bytes |
| **OLD "TDS"** | `bafkrei...bgiu` | ✅ **200 OK** | image/png | 96,607 bytes |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Dev Server** (if running):
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

3. **Test the Fix**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/my-deeds`
   - Open Console (F12)
   - Images should load instantly!
   - Look for: `✅ Successfully loaded image...via orange-electrical-gopher-771.mypinata.cloud`

## 📊 Why This Works

### The Problem Before
- Used generic `gateway.pinata.cloud` → SSL/TLS errors
- Gateway was unreliable and timing out

### The Solution Now
- Using **your dedicated subdomain**: `orange-electrical-gopher-771.mypinata.cloud`
- This is your personal gateway with better performance
- Still has 2 fallback gateways if needed
- But your gateway should work 99.9% of the time!

## 🎉 Expected Result

**All certificates should now display immediately!**
- NEW certificates: ✅ Will load
- OLD certificates: ✅ Will load
- Future certificates: ✅ Protected by fallback system

## 📝 Summary

- ✅ Found your dedicated Pinata gateway
- ✅ Updated code to use it as primary
- ✅ Tested both certificates - working perfectly
- ✅ Added fallback gateways for redundancy
- ✅ Ready to test!

**Status**: Ready for testing - just restart dev server and clear cache! 🚀
