## 🔍 Metadata Flow Analysis Results

### What We Send to Pinata:
```json
{
  "name": "Certificate Name",
  "description": "Description text",
  "image": "ipfs://QmABC123...",  // ← IPFS URI format
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Type", "value": "Educational" }
  ]
}
```

### What We Receive from Pinata:
```json
{
  "name": "Certificate Name",
  "description": "Description text",
  "image": "ipfs://QmABC123...",  // ← Same IPFS URI
  "attributes": [...]
}
```

### How We Display It:
```typescript
// 1. Get metadata from blockchain
const tokenURI = await contract.tokenURI(tokenId);
// Result: "ipfs://QmXYZ789..."

// 2. Convert to gateway URL
const metadataUrl = getIPFSGatewayUrl(tokenURI);
// Result: "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXYZ789..."

// 3. Fetch metadata JSON
const metadata = await fetch(metadataUrl).then(r => r.json());
// Result: { name, description, image: "ipfs://QmABC123..." }

// 4. Convert image IPFS to gateway URL
const imageUrl = getIPFSGatewayUrl(metadata.image);
// Result: "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmABC123..."

// 5. Display in img tag
<img src={imageUrl} />
// Displays: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmABC123...
```

**Conclusion**: The metadata flow was CORRECT. The issue was:
- ❌ No retry mechanism for temporary IPFS failures
- ❌ No fallback UI for errors
- ❌ No loading states
- ❌ No console logging to debug

**Now Fixed**: ✅ All issues resolved with comprehensive error handling!

- 🎉 = New Certificate
- 📤 = Transfer

**Example Console Output**:
```
