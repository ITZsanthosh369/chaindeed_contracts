## Critical Fixes Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. ABI Mismatch Fix
- **Issue**: `contract.requestMint is not a function` error
- **Root Cause**: Frontend using old v1.0 ABI (147 lines, only safeMint)
- **Solution**: Replaced `abi.ts` with v2.0 ABI from compilation (994 lines)
- **Verification**: `grep "requestMint" abi.ts` shows 2 matches at line 783
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 2. Role-Based Dashboards
- **Issue**: "need two types of dashboard...for admin and users"
- **Solution**: Implemented conditional rendering in `page.tsx` based on `isOwner`
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows pending requests count, admin shortcuts, contract info
- **User Dashboard**: Shows request count, NFT balance, how-it-works guide
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
